\chapter{Structures}
\label{structs}
\index{struct}

\section{Compound values}

Most of the data types we have been working with represent a single
value---an integer, a floating-point number, a character value. 
Strings are different in the sense that they are made up of smaller
pieces, the characters.  Thus, strings are an example of a
{\bf compound} type. 

Depending on what we are doing, we may want to treat a compound type
as a single thing (or object), or we may want to access its parts (or
member variables).  This ambiguity is useful.

It is also useful to be able to create your own compound values.  
C provides a mechanism for doing that: {\bf structures}.  

\section{{\tt Point} objects}
\index{Point}
\index{struct!Point}

As a simple example of a compound structure, consider the concept of a
mathematical point.  At one level, a point is two numbers
(coordinates) that we treat collectively as a single object.  In
mathematical notation, points are often written in parentheses, with a
comma separating the coordinates.  For example, $(0, 0)$ indicates the
origin, and $(x, y)$ indicates the point $x$ units to the right and
$y$ units up from the origin.

A natural way to represent a point in C is with two {\tt double}s.
The question, then, is how to group these two values into
a compound object, or structure.  The answer is a {\tt struct}
definition:

\begin{verbatim}
    typedef struct 
    {
        double x;
        double y;
    } Point_t;  
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt struct} definitions appear outside of any function definition,
usually at the beginning of the program (after the {\tt include}
statements).

This definition indicates that there are two elements in this
structure, named {\tt x} and {\tt y}.  These elements are called
the {\bf members} or {\bf fields} of a structure.
%, for reasons I will explain a little later.

It is a common error to leave off the semi-colon at the end of a
structure definition.  It might seem odd to put a semi-colon after
curly-brackets, but you'll get used to it.

Once you have defined the new structure, you can create variables
with that type:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t blank;
    blank.x = 3.0;
    blank.y = 4.0;   
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line is a conventional variable declaration: {\tt blank} has
type {\tt Point\_t}.  The next two lines initialize the fields of the
structure.  The ``dot notation'' used here is called the {\bf field selection
operator} and allows to access the structure fields.

The result of these assignments is shown in the following
state diagram:

\vspace{0.1in}

As usual, the name of the variable {\tt blank} appears outside the box
and its value appears inside the box.  In this case, that value is
a compound object with two named member variables.

\section{Accessing member variables}
\index{struct!member variable}

You can read the values of an member variable using the same syntax we
used to write them:

\begin{verbatim}
    double x = blank.x;
\end{verbatim}
%
The expression {\tt blank.x} means ``go to the object named {\tt
blank} and get the value of {\tt x}.''  In this case we assign that
value to a local variable named {\tt x}.  Notice that there is no
conflict between the local variable named {\tt x} and the member
variable named {\tt x}.  The purpose of dot notation is to identify
{\em which} variable you are referring to unambiguously.

You can use dot notation as part of any C expression, so the
following are legal.

\begin{verbatim}
    printf ("%0.1f, %0.1f\n", blank.x, blank.y);
    double distance = blank.x * blank.x + blank.y * blank.y;
\end{verbatim}
%
The first line outputs {\tt 3, 4}; the second line calculates
the value 25.

\section{Operations on structures}
\index{struct!operations}
\index{typecasting}

Most of the operators we have been using on other types, like
mathematical operators ( {\tt +}, {\tt \%}, etc.) and comparison
operators ({\tt ==}, {\tt >}, etc.), do not work on structures.
%Actually, it is possible to define the meaning of these operators
%for the new type, but we won't do that in this book.

On the other hand, the assignment operator {\em does} work for
structures.  It can be used in two ways: to initialize the member
variables of a structure or to copy the member variables from one
structure to another.  An initialization looks like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t blank = { 3.0, 4.0 };
\end{verbatim}
%
The values in squiggly braces get assigned to the member variables of
the structure one by one, in order.  So in this case, {\tt x}
gets the first value and {\tt y} gets the second.

Unfortunately, this syntax can be used only in an initialization,
not in an assignment statement.  So the following is illegal:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t blank;
    blank = { 3.0, 4.0 };       /* WRONG !! */
\end{verbatim}
%
You might wonder why this perfectly reasonable statement should
be illegal; I'm not sure, but I think the problem is that the compiler
doesn't know what type the right hand side should be.  You must specify
the type of the assignment by adding a typecast:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t blank;
    blank = (Point_t){ 3.0, 4.0 };
\end{verbatim}
%
That works.

It is legal to assign one structure to
another.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t p1 = { 3.0, 4.0 };
    Point_t p2 = p1;
    printf ("%f, %f\n", p2.x, p2.y);
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program is {\tt 3, 4}.

\section{Structures as parameters}
\label{Structures as parameters}
\index{parameter}
\index{struct!as parameter}

You can pass structures as parameters in the usual way.  For
example,

\begin{verbatim}
    void PrintPoint (Point_t point) 
    {
        printf ("(%0.1f, %0.1f)\n", point.x, point.y);
    }
\end{verbatim}
%
{\tt PrintPoint()} takes a point as an argument and outputs it in
the standard format.  If you call {\tt PrintPoint(blank)},
it will output {\tt (3.0, 4.0)}.

As a second example, we can rewrite the {\tt ComputeDistance()} function from
Section~\ref{distance} so that it takes two {\tt Point}s as parameters
instead of four {\tt double}s.

\begin{verbatim}
    double ComputeDistance (Point_t p1, Point_t p2) 
    {
        double dx = p2.x - p1.x;
        double dy = p2.y - p1.y;
        return sqrt (dx*dx + dy*dy);
    }
\end{verbatim}

\section{Call by value}
\label{Call by value}
\index{parameter passing}
\index{call by value}

When you pass a structure as an argument, remember that the
argument and the parameter are not the same variable.  Instead,
there are two variables (one in the caller and one in the
callee) that have the same value, at least initially.  For
example, when we call {\tt PrintPoint()}, the stack diagram
looks like this:

\vspace{0.1in}
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figs/stack_point2.pdf, width=6cm}}
\vspace{0.1in}
%
If {\tt PrintPoint()} happened to change one of the member variables
of {\tt point}, it would have no effect on {\tt blank}.  Of course, there
is no reason for {\tt PrintPoint()} to modify its parameter, so this
isolation between the two functions is appropriate.

This kind of parameter-passing is called ``pass by value''
because it is the value of the structure (or other type) that
gets passed to the function.

\section{Call by reference}
\label{Call by reference}
\index{parameter passing}
\index{call by reference}
\index{reference}

An alternative parameter-passing mechanism that is available
in C is called ``pass by reference.''  
By now we already know that C uses pointers as references.
This mechanism makes
it possible to pass a structure to a procedure and modify it directly.

For example, you can reflect a point around the 45-degree line by
swapping the two coordinates.  The most obvious (but incorrect) way to
write a {\tt ReflectPoint()} function is something like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    void ReflectPoint (Point_t point)      /* Does not work! */
    {
        double temp = point.x;
        point.x = point.y;
        point.y = temp;
    }
\end{verbatim}
%
This won't work, because the changes we make in {\tt ReflectPoint()}
will have no effect on the caller.

Instead, we have to specify that we want to pass the parameter by
reference.  
Our function now has a struct pointer argument {\tt Point\_t~*ptr}.


\begin{verbatim}
    void ReflectPoint (Point_t *ptr)
    {
        double temp = ptr->x;
        ptr->x = ptr->y;
        ptr->y = temp;
    }
\end{verbatim}
When we are accessing the struct member variables through a pointer 
we can no longer use the "field-selection-operator" ({\tt .}). Instead we need to use
the "pointing-to" operator ({\tt ->}).

%
We pass a reference of our struct parameter by adding the "address-of"  operator ({\tt \&}) to the
structure variable when we call the function:

\begin{verbatim}
    PrintPoint (blank);
    ReflectPoint (&blank);
    PrintPoint (blank);
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program is as expected:

\begin{verbatim}
    (3.0, 4.0)
    (4.0, 3.0)
\end{verbatim}
%
Here's how we would draw a stack diagram for this program:

\vspace{0.1in}
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figs/stack_point3.pdf, width=6.5cm}}
\vspace{0.1in}
%
The parameter {\tt ptr} is a reference to the structure named {\tt
blank}.  The usual representation for a reference is a dot with an
arrow that points to whatever the reference refers to.

The important thing to see in this diagram is that any changes that
{\tt ReflectPoint()} makes through {\tt ptr} will also affect {\tt blank}.

Passing structures by reference is more versatile than passing by
value, because the callee can modify the structure.  It is also
faster, because the system does not have to copy the whole
structure.  On the other hand, it is less safe, since it is harder to
keep track of what gets modified where.  Nevertheless, in C
programs, almost all structures are passed by reference almost all the
time.  In this book I will follow that convention.


\section{Rectangles}
\index{Rectangle}
\index{struct!Rectangle}

Now let's say that we want to create a structure to represent
a rectangle.  The question is, what information do I have to
provide in order to specify a rectangle?  To keep things simple
let's assume that the rectangle will be oriented vertically or
horizontally, never at an angle.

There are a few possibilities: I could specify the center of
the rectangle (two coordinates) and its size (width and height),
or I could specify one of the corners and the size, or I
could specify two opposing corners.

The most common choice in existing programs is to specify the
upper left corner of the rectangle and the size.  To do that
in C, we will define a structure that contains a {\tt Point\_t}
and two doubles.

\begin{verbatim}
    typedef struct 
    {
        Point_t corner;
        double width, height;
    } Rectangle_t;  
\end{verbatim}
%
Notice that one structure can contain another.  In fact, this
sort of thing is quite common.  Of course, this means that in
order to create a {\tt Rectangle\_t}, we have to create a {\tt Point\_t}
first:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t corner = { 0.0, 0.0 };
    Rectangle_t box = { corner, 100.0, 200.0 };
\end{verbatim}
%
This code creates a new {\tt Rectangle\_t} structure and initializes the
member variables.  The figure shows the effect of this assignment.

\vspace{0.1in}
\centerline{\epsfig{figure=figs/rectangle.pdf, width=6cm}}
\vspace{0.1in}
%
We can access the {\tt width} and {\tt height} in the usual way:

\begin{verbatim}
    box.width += 50.0;
    printf("%f\n", box.width);
\end{verbatim}
%
In order to access the member variables of {\tt corner}, we can use a
temporary variable:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t temp = box.corner;
    double x = temp.x;
\end{verbatim}
%
Alternatively, we can compose the two statements:

\index{composition}

\begin{verbatim}
    double x = box.corner.x;
\end{verbatim}
%
It makes the most sense to read this statement from right to
left: ``Extract {\tt x} from the {\tt corner} of the {\tt box},
and assign it to the local variable {\tt x}.''

While we are on the subject of composition, I should point
out that you can, in fact, create the {\tt Point} and the
{\tt Rectangle} at the same time:

\begin{verbatim}
    Rectangle_t box = { { 0.0, 0.0 }, 100.0, 200.0 };
\end{verbatim}
%
The innermost squiggly braces are the coordinates of the
corner point; together they make up the first of the three
values that go into the new {\tt Rectangle}.  This statement
is an example of {\bf nested structure}.

\index{nested structure}


\section{Structures as return types}
\index{struct!as return type}
\index{return}
\index{statement!return}

You can write functions that return structures.  For example,
{\tt FindCenter()} has a {\tt Rectangle\_t} parameter and
returns a {\tt Point\_t} that contains the coordinates of the
center of the rectangle:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t FindCenter (Rectangle_t box)
    {
        double x = box.corner.x + box.width/2;
        double y = box.corner.y + box.height/2;
        Point_t result = {x, y};
        return result;
    }
\end{verbatim}
%
To call this function, we have to pass a {\tt Rectangle\_t} as an argument
(notice that it is being passed by value), and assign the
return value to a {\tt Point\_t} variable:

\begin{verbatim}
    Rectangle_t box = { {0.0, 0.0}, 100, 200 };
    Point_t center = FindCenter (box);
    PrintPoint (center);
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program is {\tt (50, 100)}.

We could have passed the structure as a reference to the
function. In this case our function would look like this:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t FindCenter (Rectangle_t *box)
    {
        double x = box->corner.x + box->width/2;
        double y = box->corner.y + box->height/2;
        Point_t result = {x, y};
        return result;
    }
\end{verbatim}
Notice, how we had to change the access to the members of the 
structure, since {\tt box} is now a pointer. 
We would also have to change the function call for {\tt FindCenter()}:

\begin{verbatim}
    Point_t center = FindCenter (&box);
\end{verbatim}

\section {Passing other types by reference}
\index{parameter passing}
\index{call by reference}
\index{reference}

It's not just structures that can be passed by reference.
All the other types we've seen can, too.  For example, to swap
two integers, we could write something like:

\begin{verbatim}
    void Swap (int *x, int *y)
    {
        int temp = *x;
        *x = *y;
        *y = temp;
    }
\end{verbatim}
%
We would call this function in the usual way:

\begin{verbatim}
    int i = 7;
    int j = 9;
    printf (" i=%i, j=%i\n", i, j);
    Swap (&i, &j);
    printf (" i=%i, j=%i\n", i, j);
\end{verbatim}
%
The output of this program shows that the variable
values have been swapped.  Draw a stack
diagram for this program to convince yourself this is true.
If the parameters {\tt x} and {\tt y} were declared as
regular integer variables (without the {\tt \*}s), {\tt Swap()} would
not work.  It would modify {\tt x} and {\tt y} and have no
effect on {\tt i} and {\tt j}.

When people start passing things like integers by reference,
they often try to use an expression
as a reference argument.  For example:

\begin{verbatim}
    int i = 7;
    int j = 9;
    Swap (&i, &j+1);         /* WRONG!! */
\end{verbatim}
%
Presumably the programmer wanted to increase the value of {\tt j} by {\tt 1}
before it is passed to the function.
This does not work as expected, because the expression {\tt j+1} now
is interpreted a pointer value and in now pointing to a memory
location beyond the variable {\tt j}. 
It is a little tricky to figure out exactly
what kinds of expressions make sense to be passed by reference.  For now
a good rule of thumb is that reference arguments have to be
variables.
